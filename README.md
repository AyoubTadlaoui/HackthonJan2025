Create a visually appealing and interactive demo combining voice synthesis, generative AI, and 3D visualizations.
Proposed Tech Stack:
Frontend:
Three.js: For 3D rendering and interactive visuals.
React.js: To handle UI and interactions.
WebGL/Shader Effects: To add flair to 3D visuals.
Backend:
ElevenLabs API: For realistic voice synthesis.
MidJourney-like AI: Use prompts to generate images (use Stable Diffusion or similar for practical implementation).
RunwayML: For video generation or model inference.
WebSim.ai: Integrate real-time simulation or AI-based analytics into the experience if applicable to the project.
Demo Structure:
Landing Page:
3D animation (inspired by the Three.js examples).
Minimalistic UI with an interactive start button.
Voice Interaction:
Allow users to enter text.
Use ElevenLabs to convert text into synthesized speech.
Generative Art:
Integrate image generation (via Stable Diffusion or similar) using a prompt entered by the user.
Showcase images within a dynamic 3D gallery using Three.js.
Dynamic 3D Scene:
Include interactive objects like floating spheres, portals, or fractals.
Add user-controlled camera movement, zoom, or a VR-like feel.
Real-time Simulation (Optional):
Use WebSim.ai to simulate some AI-based decision-making or physics.
Example: Simulate an AI agent navigating a maze displayed in the 3D space.
Export/Download Feature:
Let users save generated content (images/audio/videos) as a takeaway from the demo.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
